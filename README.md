# Website for My Wedding
On May 15, 2022, I was married to my beautiful wife, Alyssa. Before the big day, however, we knew we were going to need some sort of RSVP/registry system to provide for our guests. Various websites provided options that seemed viable, but either cost money, used advertisements, or were otherwise undesirable.

Realizing my experience as a web developer, my then-fiance and I decided to use this chance to create a website that could perform the functions we desired. While the site itself is not particularly beautiful, it was built rather quickly and with just enough functionality to work for us. Thus, this project was born.

Some of the data (particularly in the front-end) is rather personal, but stored data (in the MySQL database) is not provided in this repo.
